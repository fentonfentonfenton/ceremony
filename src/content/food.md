## Food


If you would like to contribute cake / food / drink: thanks for offering!

### tl;dr:

Please bring cake, handheld snacks and nonalcoholic/alcoholic drinks. Vegetarian is good.

**No red wine.** The venue has a no red wine policy.

### Details

The venue we are partying in is totally scoped out to have a very formal sit down meal...

But this isn't going to be that kind of party.

### Eating

We'll have some tables laid out a bit more ad lib and provide some refreshments, snacks and a pizza party after 7PM. So there will be an opportunity for us all to gather around tables feasting, if you want you could do something else like sit in the yurt or smoke or whatever at that time though and stuff a slice of pizza into your gob in the disabled loos when no-one is looking.

There is a small kitchen and tea making facilities [bring your own tea if you hate most tea]. We'll try and have some non-dairy milks to hand.

The staff are handing out teas at circa 3P.M where we would probably have cake, if there is some, although cake can be eaten any time, of course.

We chose pizza as it's handheld, and doesn't introduce much mess. We encourage that any other food you contribute is similar. 

The small kitchen may enable you to create something more complicated but that is at your own peril. Probably good for sorting kids food in though.

73% of the birthday celebrants are vegetarian. So it'll be that vibe, **BYOM** if you really need some meat.

### Drinks

We've arranged a pile of ice to come which will be useful for those who want to create mocktails, cocktails or crazy softdrinks - and to keep drinks cold when the fridge is full up.

With kids and sober people there, there will be a variety of 0% stuff and soft stuff to go along with the tea.

We encourage non drinkers to contribute some more, although you could just pop to the shops or get something delivered adhoc, coz you'll know what you want at the time. Up to you!

For less 0% inclined folk, then the same rules apply, bring some stuff if you like, but absolutely **No red wine** because it is banned by the venue. Maybe people will chip in on shop runs or deliveroos during the day. There are shops next door if you get to the party and your favourite drink is unavailable.
