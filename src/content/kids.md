## Kids

Good news!

There has been sufficient interest from people with kids to make it worthwhile doing something to make it as kid friendly as possible

What does this mean?

It means that a childrens party hire company will turn up and unload a bunch of things like softplay sets, vehicular things to ride around and bubble based fun. And then they will come and collect it at the end of the day. So it'll be gone by 6.

It probably doesn't mean Moogz will dress as Upsy Daisy and do facepaint but who knows - the venue is nice and the main rules they have are about staining, so we'll try and not cover the yurt in too much glitter.

### The venue

The venue has a rather large heated indoor space and another rather comfortable heated yurt. 
During the first 5 hours the yurt is a parent and child friendly place (with softplay things) and the larger space will have some other fun things. Unless they're old kids and then they'll probably be running riot and think the fun things are stupid. But that is out of our control.

The venue has seating and tables so you will be able to arrange snacking and meals. There is a small kitchen you can use for prep.

There will be food floating about but you'll bring your kids their own anyway - maybe we'll group together on the day and organise an earlier (than the adults) pizza delivery or something for the kids in general.

Shops are nearby! Loads of them. You could get a delivery of anything you want too.


### The timings

You probably will be the most prompt of all the revellers, but if you're not then that's cool.

Although we get let in at 1P.M. the things that arrive (softplay, etc) may not be installed yet and there will probably be a bit of an 'early at the house party' vibe going on.

You might prefer that kind of atmosphere anyway.


Coming towards 6P.M. We are expecting the party to start heading into a more adult direction and it's probably advisable to start ferrying kids home as it gets later, although maybe you won't want to - which is also fine - but you might have to share the yurt with an itinerant adult who eats all your kids pizza. It's no pizza in the yurt though, BTW and definitely no red wine! 

Any questions - reach out!
