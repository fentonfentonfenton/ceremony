## Volunteers

**Thanks for volunteering!**


At the [Centre for Reconciliation and Peace](https://stethelburgas.org/venue-hire/) we want our Â©eremony to be wicked AF.

In order to do this we would greatly appreciate some help from our friends.

We also want the experience to be chilled AF and not feel like work, for anyone that doesn't want to work.


So we are offering a bunch of optional hats you can wear for all or parts of your visit. They're not real hats.
