## PERFORMERS

Thanks for offering to perform!

The venue is nicely specced-out, it's got a 2K Bose sound-system (that we might get in trouble if we turn up to 11, says the FAQ) with a small mixing desk for inputs, tables/chairs and a lovely Yurt outside that might turn into an acoustic-only jam shed after dark.

There is a massive projector for video.

So we'd love it if people want to play music / play instruments / read (poetry/other words) / do a presentation / perform some other art / videos / photos / get AI to perform. We're open to ideas.

Moogz and Jack don't want to have to deal with too much faff unloading in the middle of the night [we will just want to walk off into it instead] so we're going to keep our technical contribution to a minimum - we're thinking of playing off a laptop/phone as being the height of our compatibilities. 

That being said... we had a few informal offers from people wanting to bring more equipment. Like, if you brought decks I am sure people would smash out banging sets on them, etc. 
But we just want you to be sure that you will want those decks on you at 2A.M. in London in November. In the snow. When you're 'drunk'. So don't go mental.

### DJs

Loads of our friends are DJs -  luckily it looks like some of them just want to wake up tied to a lampost so we'd love it if you brought music - we'll know more about what people can play off closer to the date but if you can mix off your phone/laptop then brilliant.

Every fake wedding needs a fake wedding DJ, too, so we would be especially interested in people who would like to play stuff during the day when it's a bit more family wedding and less rave so if you have a radio-friendly family bangers set you have stashed then please let it rip.

Hardcore raving DJ sets will be needed later, with no guarantee we will have space for everyone.

Other slots may be taken up by jukebox style music selection and playlists. Have a playlist? Hook us up!

### Poetry/Art

There's microphones, we'll allocate you some time or get you on at random to perform, you can do whatever (within reason!)

### Musical Instruments / Sound Art

We would love there to be plenty of moments where people are just noodling on things / tapping a drum and we're going to make as much space for that as possible too.

### Video

Bring your stuff hopefully it'll fit down an HDMI cable

Anything else?
Let us know!
